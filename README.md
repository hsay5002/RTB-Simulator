# RTB AdTech Simulator üéØ

A Python-based Real-Time Bidding (RTB) simulation to understand how programmatic advertising auctions work behind the scenes. This project models a simplified AdTech ecosystem with Advertisers, Campaigns, Publishers, and an Ad Exchange.

## Features

‚úÖ Simulates second-price auctions (industry standard)  
‚úÖ Models multiple advertisers and campaigns  
‚úÖ Tracks advertiser and campaign budgets  
‚úÖ Outputs realistic auction logs and budget consumption  
‚úÖ Easy to extend for geotargeting, CTR, eCPM logic, and pacing

## Project Structure

```
RTB-AdTech-Simulator/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities.py        # Advertiser and Campaign class definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ad_exchange.py     # Auction logic for second-price auctions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simulator.py       # Simulation engine that runs bid requests and prints results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project overview and instructions
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.x

### 2. Run the Simulation

```bash
python simulator.py
```

You‚Äôll see 10 randomized auctions printed in your terminal.

### 3. Sample Output

```
[AdTechX Exchange] Auction - BidRequest ID: 101, Keywords: ['sports', 'fitness']
  > Bid from Nike Inc. (Campaign: 'RunMax Shoes') - $1.50
  > Bid from Amazon Ads (Campaign: 'FitSpace') - $1.30
  Winner: Nike Inc. ($1.30) [Second-highest: $1.30]
  ‚úîÔ∏è Charged Nike Inc. Remaining: $4998.70
```

## Extension Ideas

- Add CTR (Click-Through Rate) to compute eCPM = max_bid √ó CTR  
- Introduce geolocation and device targeting  
- Support both first-price and second-price modes  
- Add pacing and frequency capping
